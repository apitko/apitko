- 👋 Hi, I’m @apitko
- 👀 I’m interested in supporting the BTC network, I am hosting a Bitcoin Core node. A lifelong systems and web engineer and have only dabbled in programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI trading systems, SuperAlgos. I had to setup a new account on Github to get away from my work account which is shared.
- 💞️ I’m looking to help with any projects, adding suggestions, test code, contribute to others work and hopefully contribute my own!
- 📫 How to reach me? Right here!
